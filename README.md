When a user lands on the page they should be presented with:

- a random word that is fetched from https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/
- a countdown timer
- a score

When the user types the word correctly they get points and are presented with a new word until they are out of time

Please add a Key.js file in folder src/API, and add a key generated from the site above and export it:
for example my Key.js file looks like this: export default 'WRGN6302';

Site is live: https://vigilant-cori-ec17e4.netlify.com/

I spent approximately 2 hours on the project:
- 45 min on the actual project
- 15 min to figure out how netlify works
- 1 hour to realize that I spelled event.preventDefault() with a lowercase d instead of a uppercase D
